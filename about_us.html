            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                In 1947, this dream became a reality when the first General High School was established on a 90,499-square-meter site at the heart of the Municipality of Lambunao. In 1977, the school evolved into the Lambunao Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).

                Progress continued steadily, culminating in the integration of LIST into the West Visayas State University family in 2000, as mandated by Republic Act No. 8292, known as the Commission of Higher Education Modernization Act.
                
                For over a decade, WVSU-Lambunao Campus has relentlessly pursued excellence in education and community service. A significant milestone occurred in December 2009 when the campus submitted its Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) program for its first AACCUP (Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines) preliminary visit, making it the first external campus to seek accreditation.
                
                Since then, we have made significant strides, with all our curricular programs earning accreditation from AACCUP: BEED, BSED (English and Math) at Level III; BTVTED, BSIT, BSHM, BS Information Technology, MAEd (Reading & Administration and Supervision), Doctor of Education, MSCrim, and BS Criminology, with the latter being our flagship program, at Level II. Additionally, BSED(Fil) achieved Level I accreditation.
                
                The school has also undergone evaluation by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and obtained ISO Certification in 2018, meeting the 9001:2015 standard. Furthermore, the Commission on Higher Education awarded the campus a Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC). We have expanded our program offerings to include BSED Major in Social Studies.
                
                WVSU-Lambunao Campus proudly launched the “WVSU-Helps” Extension program, designed to assist the Lambunao LGU and the DSWD’s Program 4Ps. This initiative, titled “PL na, Teacher Pa,” was recognized as the Regional Winner and National Finalist for Best Knowledge Management Initiative by DSWD Region 6.
                
                Our accomplishments extend to producing graduates who have excelled both locally and internationally. We take pride in being one of the external campuses that have produced topnotchers in the Licensure Examination for Teachers.
                
                Through productive and progressive years, the name of West Visayas State University Lambunao Campus has resounded in the field of education in the 3rd District of Iloilo and the broader region. Despite our achievements, we remain committed to delivering quality education, and transforming the lives of our students and communities alike.
